# VR_StarShip

## Project Overview
**VR_StarShip** is an immersive Virtual Reality project developed using Unity and designed for Meta Quest 3. In this experience, players are tasked with navigating and managing various systems aboard a futuristic spaceship. The project showcases advanced VR interaction mechanics, realistic physics, and an engaging space environment.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Object Handling:** Use the XR Interaction Toolkit to grab, throw, and manipulate objects within the spaceship.
- **Puzzle-Solving Mechanics:** Engage in various puzzles that involve interacting with buttons, doors, and energy sources to maintain the ship's operations.
- **Spaceship Navigation:** Control the ship's movement using a steering wheel and gear system.
- **Realistic Physics:** Experience zero-gravity effects and realistic object interactions using Unity's physics system.
- **Visual and Environmental Design:** Explore a meticulously designed spaceship interior with stunning views of outer space.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity**: Game engine used to develop the project.
- **XR Interaction Toolkit**: Used for implementing VR interactions.
- **Meta Quest 3**: Target platform for the VR experience.
- **C# Scripting**: Custom scripts for gameplay mechanics and interactions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krngrover6/VR_StarShip.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Make sure your Meta Quest 3 device is connected.
4. Press the "Play" button in Unity to start the project in VR.

## How to Play
- **Move**: Use the Meta Quest 3 controllers to navigate through the spaceship.
- **Interact**: Grab, throw, and manipulate objects by pointing at them and pressing the grab button on the controller.
- **Solve Puzzles**: Press buttons, open doors, and manage energy sources to keep the spaceship operational.
- **Control the Ship**: Use the steering wheel and gear to navigate through space.

## Key Scripts
- **Laser Gun Script**: Controls the activation and deactivation of the laser gun used to break space debris.
- **Button Push Door Script**: Handles the interaction with buttons that open and close sliding doors.
- **Teleportation Script**: Allows players to move quickly between different areas of the spaceship.

## Challenges Faced
- Implementing realistic physics in a zero-gravity environment.
- Ensuring smooth and intuitive VR interactions.
- Balancing the difficulty of puzzles to be engaging but not frustrating.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more complex puzzles and interactive elements.
- Expand the spaceship environment with additional compartments.
- Refine VR interactions for an even more immersive experience.
